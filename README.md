# Creating-a-ReadMe-File
Summary for computer applications class with Dr. Pennington
-VHG

  Today in class we went over the **basic command lines** that we did last week. This was a great refresher because I had learned the basic commands roughly three years ago, but have obviously forgotten them. The most useful command, in my opinion to this point, is the **change directory (cd)** command line. This allows me to easily navigate through my files and folders. The other commands are also useful. I remember using 'vi' to create geologic maps in the past. Or at least I think it was in 'vi' but I do remember I did it through the terminal. It was very painful work.
  
  Git-Hub is something completely new to me. Honestly, I am still a bit lost on this. What I understand so far about it is that it can be used to collaborate with other people on projects when writing code. Other than that I know how to create a repository. Making changes to font is not as straight forward as I would hope but I think if I want to make something **bold** I have to put a double asterisk before and after the word. For *italics* it is only one asterisk before and after the word. I have obviously gone back and bolded a few words in my previous text. The following are examples of me playing around with the font excercises.
  
  *this text will be italic*
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
